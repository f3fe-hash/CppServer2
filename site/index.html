            <h1>CppServer2</h1>

            <p class="text">
                CppServer2 is a high-performance, minimal-overhead server framework written in C++. Designed for developers who need speed, control, and direct access to system-level resources, itâ€™s built with bare-metal efficiency in mind. 
                The framework offers a lightweight architecture ideal for production-grade applications where performance and resource optimization are critical. 

                CppServer2 is highly configurable and requires minimal setup, making it easy to get started without sacrificing flexibility or power. It leverages Unix-based system headers and functionality to ensure low-level access and reliability, all while maintaining a clean, concise codebase that's easy to understand, extend, and maintain.

                Whether you're building microservices, embedded tools, or custom networking protocols, CppServer2 provides a robust foundation with performance and simplicity at its core.
