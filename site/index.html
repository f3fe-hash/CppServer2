            <p id="text">
                CppServer is a high-performance, minimal-overhead server framework written in C++, designed
                for developers who need speed, control, and direct access to system-level resources. Built with bare-metal efficiency
                in mind, it offers a lightweight and efficient architecture that’s ideal for production-grade applications where
                performance and resource optimization are critical. The server is highly configurable, requiring minimal setup,
                making it extremely easy to get started without sacrificing flexibility or power. It makes full use of Unix-based
                system headers and functionality to provide low-level access and reliability, while maintaining a clean and concise
                codebase that is easy to understand, extend, and maintain. Whether you're building microservices, embedded tools, or
                custom networking protocols, CppServer offers a robust foundation that’s both intuitive and powerful, with performance
                and simplicity at its core.
